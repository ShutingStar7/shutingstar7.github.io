Welcome!



---
I am a PhD candidate at NUS Business School, and I am visiting the Department of Finance of UT McCombs Business School. My research interests lie in urban economics, real estate, and applied microeconomics, with a particular focus on infrastructure, air pollution, and sustainability. I am expected to graduate in 2025.
